Will need Labeo package Umit-master: https://github.com/LabeoTech/

Example data will be available on dandiarchive.org (work in progress because of bug, 1-11-24).

Try "Example_data_pipeline" to go through the steps of a single acquisition. 
For the pipeline with all mice, do Preprocessing_Pipeline_CaCl_GCaMP first, then Umit_Pipeline_CaCl_GCaMP and lastly Pipeline_CaCl_GCaMP
